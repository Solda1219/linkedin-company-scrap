I have company urls and looking for page followers, post:comments count, shares count, reactions (thumbsups etc) and post ids

Output should include:
Page url, followers count, posts from 1/1/2021 (need historical for one time) Post url/id/comments count/shares count/text/all reactions thumbsups and etc in dictionary or as you like , after running it on historical data I'll change date so on a daily basis I'll need only last 7 days posts data which will be fairly low amount
